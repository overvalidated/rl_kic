For some fucked reason PPO-Adam and PPO-RMSprop both struggle to improve after very quick amount of time.  
May be the problem is connected to the reward function.  
Knowing how I write code the reason can be hiding inside of environment.  
AlphaZero struggle to do anything too...
And PPO-SGD[rllib] too...


1) Reward
2) Bugs in environment and/or reward computation. 
3)
